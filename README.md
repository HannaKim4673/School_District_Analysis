# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Jupyter notebook, pandas, python, and numpy were used to analyze student funding, school information, and students' standardized math and reading test scores for the state board of education. The main goal of this analysis was to find patterns and relationships amongst provided student funding, school, and students' test score information to help the state board of education make decisions, like how school budgets should be allocated. In the case of the challenge, the goal was to remove data that the state board of education discovered was altered (i.e., the math and reading test scores for Thomas High School 9th graders), run the analysis again, and see how the removal of the altered data affected the results of the analysis.
